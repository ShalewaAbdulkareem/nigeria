    <h1>NIGERIA COAT OF ARM </h1>
    <p>The origin of the term coat of arms is in the surcoat, the cloth tunic worn over armour to shield it from the sun's rays. It repeated the bearer's arms as they appeared on his banner or pennon and on his shield, and it was particularly useful to the heralds as they toured the battlefield identifying the dead.</p>
    <p>A coat of arms is a hereditary device, borne upon a shield, and devised according to a recognised system. This system was developed in northern Europe in the mid-12th century for the purpose of identification and was very widely adopted by kings, princes, knights and other major power holders throughout western Europe.</p>
    <p>A coat of arms is a symbol used to identify families or individuals. It is a detailed design that often includes a shield, crest, helmet, motto, and more. The image could be used as a whole, or the crest can be used as a simplified symbol.</p>
    <h2>FEATURES OF NIGERIA'S COAT OF ARMS</h2>
    <p> Nigeria’s coat of arms has seven features, and each one represents a unique quality attributed to Nigeria.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The black shield: The black shield is a reference to the country’s fertile soil.</li>
        <li>The wavy white pall: This occupies some space in the middle of the black shield. The symbol that forms the shape of the letter “Y” is a nod to the country’s two main inland rivers — River Niger and River Benue. Both rivers meet at a point in Lokoja to form a confluence, hence the “Y” shape.</li> 
        <li>The two horses: The horses on each side of the black shield are symbols of Nigeria’s dignity. Nigerians are proud people, so this is very fitting.</li>
        <li>The red eagle: This represents the country’s strength.</li> 
        <li>The green and white wreath: This rest on top of the shield and beneath the eagle. It is a reference to the agricultural potentials of the country.</li>
        <li>The grassy field and flowers: The flowers at the bottom of the coat of arms are called Costus Spectabilis, and they were Nigeria’s national flower. The decision behind the inclusion of this flower is that it is found all over the country. It represents the country’s beauty.
        The National motto: It reads “Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress”.</li>
        </ul>
