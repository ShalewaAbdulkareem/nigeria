    <h1>ABOUT NIGERIA </h1>
    <p>Nigeria became independent from Britain on October 1, 1960. Nigeria is the political, economic and demographic key country on the African continent. With a population of approximately 182 million Nigeria is Africa's most populous country. Population growth was 2.5 percent in 2013. The capital Abuja is located in the center of the country with a population of approx. 3 mio. The commercial capital Lagos boasts more than 22 mio. inhabitants. The political agenda of the country is characterized by major security challenges in the form of combating the violent extremist group Boko Haram in the North and controlling militant groups in the South. With the accession of President Buhari in May 2015, the fight against Boko Haram and corruption and the recovery of the country's economy has come into focus.</p>
        
       <p> The country is characterized by a dynamic economy, high economic growth of about 6-7 % a year and a growing demand for non-domestic products. As a result of the fall in oil prices the growth forecasts for the coming years have been somewhat downgraded. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and among the top ten producers worldwide. Nigeria is a key economic player in Africa and has a huge economic potential. The country overtook South Africa in 2014 and became Africa's largest economy. Together with Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey ( MINT-countries) Nigeria is considered as a future economic power, and has the potential to be among the world's ten largest economies. Despite this, Nigeria is a low income country, and the country suffers from extreme corruption and inequality. 60 % of the population lives below the UN poverty line. In addition, significant regional differences between the wealthier south and the much poorer north of the country exist.</p>
        
       <p>Nigeria is the most important political player in the region, not least when it comes to regional stability, including in connection with maritime safety in the Gulf of Guinea. The country also plays a major role in conflict resolution in the region. The difficult security situation in the Northeastern states caused by Boko Haram rampage has caused a major humanitarian crisis with more than 2.2 million internally displaced and nearly 150,000 Nigerian refugees in neighboring countries. Through international aid organizations Denmark has so far contributed 45.6 mio. kr. to help these vulnerable groups.Abuja is home to the headquarters of ECOWAS - the key West African economic integration organization, peace and security. The organization has played a significant role in the region's different conflicts and mediation efforts in Mali and Burkina Faso.</p>
